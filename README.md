#Examples for DevDay 2016 Tech Talk on Reactive Programming


There are two folders in this repository;

 1. The "web" folder consists of the browser based examples such as autocomplete, triple click, and reactive sum
note: JavaScript files for separate examples are available in the "js-examples" folder.

 2. The "node" folder consists of the backend for frontend (BFF) that was demonstrated on the tech talk.

This repo includes the 3rd party dependencies such as Express.JS and JQuery so that it will be easier for you to run and test the examples.
